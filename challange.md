Hi there, thanks for taking the time to show us your skills! By stepping up to this challenge, you give us a chance to see if and how you would fit in with the team in terms of technical capability.
We leave a lot of things in this challenge up to you and that is by design; if it's not specifically mentioned, feel free to pick and choose and inform us about those choices.
We request that you complete the challenge using PHP and its supporting web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and MySQL or PostgreSQL as the data store.
Don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.
Good luck!

Our focus points
Since we would like to see how you think, please do not make use of an existing framework or ORM, rather keep it simple and do your own work. We will be on the lookout for a few specific things:
Your approach to development problems in general
Your proficiency in understanding and writing queries
Your ability to create effective solutions
Just working code is not enough, we highly value good, clean code. Your code should be secure and well structured, it should be easy to understand and capable of scaling.

Time constraints
Every one of us has gone through the phase you're in now: doing interviews while working a full work week at your current job. And we bet every company is asking you to complete their own challenge, just like we do, within a certain time frame. It's a busy time for you and we realise that.
The thing is: we can't distinguish between excellent candidates that haven't put in the time and the ones that did put in a lot more time but wouldn't have the technical skills yet to feel comfortably challenged in our teams.
If you feel like you don't have enough time to show off your skills, simply ask us for more. It's ok, really! But we do like to know that up front, not on the day you agreed to turn it in; actually just as soon as you realise that you need just a day or two more.

The Challenge
We’d like you to build a UI and API that allows a user to capture invoices as shown in the image below, and store the data in a database. You can assume that your solution is part of a bigger system, so you do not need to implement authentication or additional list/view screens. Keep in mind how invoices would be handled in a real system - some elements would be pre-configured or selectable, rather than being captured from scratch.
You can pre-populate the database however you wish. We will review and test your solution as we would production code, meaning input validation/error handling is important. 
Our requirements are:
That your solution is based in PHP and MySQL/PostgreSQL
That you use plain SQL queries, and not an ORM
That your solution be web based
